# Thrift Tutorial
# Thanks to Mark Slee (mcslee@facebook.com)
#
# This file aims to teach you how to use Thrift, in a .thrift file. Neato. The
# first thing to notice is that .thrift files support standard shell comments.
# This lets you make your thrift file executable and include your Thrift build
# step on the top line. And you can place comments like this anywhere you like.
#
# Before running this file, you will need to have installed the thrift compiler
# into /usr/local/bin.
# 
# Generate java files:  thrift --gen java krunchykreme.thrift
# Generate php files:   thrift --gen php krunchykreme.thrift

/**
 * The first thing to know about are types. The available types in Thrift are:
 *
 *  bool        Boolean, one byte
 *  byte        Signed byte
 *  i16         Signed 16-bit integer
 *  i32         Signed 32-bit integer
 *  i64         Signed 64-bit integer
 *  double      64-bit floating point value
 *  string      String
 *  binary      Blob (byte array)
 *  map<t1,t2>  Map from one type to another
 *  list<t1>    Ordered list of one type
 *  set<t1>     Set of unique elements of one type
 *
 * Did you also notice that Thrift supports C style comments?

   * field lists in struct or exception definitions.
